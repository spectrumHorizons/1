        <p className="text-2xl  leading-loose">
            I have four years of web development experience, specializing in backend technologies. For three years, I excelled
            in PHP, working with the Laravel framework. In the last two years, I transitioned to Node.js, specializing in Express
            and Nest.js.
            Proficient in MySQL and
            PostgresSQL, my approach emphasizes project success, and I am committed to staying current with industry
            trends
